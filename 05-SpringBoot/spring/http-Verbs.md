HTTP Verbs
==========


GET
----
The GET method is designed to request a specific resource. In essence, it literally "gets" the resource in question, and is pretty limited to just that action. GET requests should only retrieve data, leaving other methods to perform the other transformative actions.

The HTTP GET method is used to `read` (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the "happy" (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).

According to the design of the HTTP specification, GET (along with HEAD) requests are used only to read data and not change it. Therefore, when used this way, they are considered safe. That is, they can be called without risk of data modification or corruption—calling it once has the same effect as calling it 10 times, or none at all. Additionally, GET (and HEAD) is idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests ends up having the same result as a single request.

Do not expose unsafe operations via GET—it should never modify any resources on the server.

**Examples:**
- GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345
- GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders
- GET http://www.example.com/buckets/sample

POST
----
POST affects the related resources attached to a targeted resource. POST allows an API to submit an attribute or entity to a given resource; in practice, this means the targeted resource receives a subordinate resource that is part of a larger collection

The POST verb is most-often utilized to `create` new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc.

On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.

POST is neither safe nor idempotent. It is therefore recommended for non-idempotent resource requests. Making two identical POST requests will most-likely result in two resources containing the same information.

**Examples:**
- POST http://www.example.com/customers
- POST http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders

PUT
----
PUT is somewhat the polar opposite of GET. While GET requests a specific resource, PUT places that resource in the remote directory. It should be noted that PUT assumes either the resource does not exist or the resource is fine to be overwritten – when using PUT, all representations of the target resource will be replaced by the payload.

PUT is most-often utilized for `update` capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.

However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. Again, the request body contains a resource representation. Many feel this is convoluted and confusing. Consequently, this method of creation should be used sparingly, if at all.

Alternatively, use POST to create new resources and provide the client-defined ID in the body representation—presumably to a URI that doesn't include the ID of the resource (see POST below).

On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. A body in the response is optional—providing one consumes more bandwidth. It is not necessary to return a link via a Location header in the creation case since the client already set the resource ID.

PUT is not a safe operation, in that it modifies (or creates) state on the server, but it is idempotent. In other words, if you create or update a resource using PUT and then make that same call again, the resource is still there and still has the same state as it did with the first call.

If, for instance, calling PUT on a resource increments a counter within the resource, the call is no longer idempotent. Sometimes that happens and it may be enough to document that the call is not idempotent. However, it's recommended to keep PUT requests idempotent. It is strongly recommended to use POST for non-idempotent requests.

**Examples:**
- PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345
- PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765
- PUT http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff

DELETE
----
DELETE is the most clear-cut method on this list because it does exactly what’s on the tin – DELETE deletes a targeted resource. The typical response for a deletion method is simply to reply with an "OK" status – either the resource was deleted, or it was not.

DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to `delete` a resource identified by a URI.

On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body, perhaps the representation of the deleted item (often demands too much bandwidth), or a wrapped response (see Return Values below). Either that or return HTTP status 204 (NO CONTENT) with no response body. In other words, a 204 status with no body, or the JSEND-style response and HTTP status 200 are the recommended responses.

HTTP-spec-wise, DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it's removed. Repeatedly calling DELETE on that resource ends up the same: the resource is gone. If calling DELETE say, decrements a counter (within the resource), the DELETE call is no longer idempotent. As mentioned previously, usage statistics and measurements may be updated while still considering the service idempotent as long as no resource data is changed. Using POST for non-idempotent resource requests is recommended.

There is a caveat about DELETE idempotence, however. Calling DELETE on a resource a second time will often return a 404 (NOT FOUND) since it was already removed and therefore is no longer findable. This, by some opinions, makes DELETE operations no longer idempotent, however, the end-state of the resource is the same. Returning a 404 is acceptable and communicates accurately the status of the call.

**Examples:**
- DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345
- DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders
- DELETE http://www.example.com/bucket/sample

PATCH
----
PATCH is designed to partially modify a targeted resource. In other words, while PUT places a resource in the target service, PATCH modifies that resource, as opposed to replacing it. This is a good way to update files or versions.

PATCH is used for `modify` capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.

This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch.

PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent. However, a PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent, which also helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the same resource in a similar time frame. Collisions from multiple PATCH requests may be more dangerous than PUT collisions because some patch formats need to operate from a known base-point or else they will corrupt the resource. Clients using this kind of patch application should use a conditional request such that the request will fail if the resource has been updated since the client last accessed the resource. For example, the client can use a strong ETag in an If-Match header on the PATCH request.

**Examples:**
- PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345
- PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765
- PATCH http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff

OPTIONS
----
The OPTIONS method changes the different communication options held by the target resource. This can be used to both open up more channels of communication and lock them down – for this reason, the OPTIONS method should be considered akin to a faucet which can be opened and closed with relative granularity.

HEAD
----
HEAD is an interesting method in that it mirrors some functionality of another METHOD while unlocking additional possibilities. HEAD requests a GET response from a given resource, but with the response body excised. While that may seem overly simplistic, it allows greater flexibility and power for other API extensions – for instance, you can pass the headers of a resource to another request in an attempt to mimic a different requesting environment or situation, which is extremely helpful for testing and troubleshooting.
