# Exception Handling

## Errors in general life

Error refers to an illegal operation performed by the user which results in the abnormal working of the program. 

Programming errors often remain undetected until the program is compiled or executed. Some of the errors inhibit the program from getting compiled or executed. Thus errors should be removed before compiling and executing. It is of three types:
- Compile-time : Compile-Time Errors: Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing syntax are known as Compile-Time errors. This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. 
    - Most frequent Compile-Time errors are:
        - Missing Parenthesis (})
        - Printing the value of variable without declaring it
        - Missing semicolon (terminator)

- Run-time 
    - Division error
    - File not found

- Logical 
    - Not getting wanted result
